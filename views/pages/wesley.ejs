                        <p>Wesley hasn't written this yet, so Alex is writing a little tid bit about this cool dude. Wesley graduated from Valdosta State a few months after me and started working in IT at a credit union. It was...interesting...he got to work with a proprietary software language based off of COBOL #neveragain. In 2018 we found out we were expecting our little dude and moved to Atlanta to be closer to Wesley's family. He got a job not too soon after working as a contractor at the CDC. He stayed there for just over a year and then found a job working as a Java Developer for Hudson MX making ad tech software. He recently got a job working for COX Automotive on the Clutch team.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>In his spare time, Wesley enjoys watching Atlanta United and Manchester United games, playing classical guitar and defeating demons in Warhammer.</p>
