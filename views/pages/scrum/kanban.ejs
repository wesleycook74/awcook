                                    that uses a visual, Work-In-Progress (WIP) limited pull system. The flow
                                    optimization practices of Kanban provide Scrum Teams with additional opportunities
                                    to inspect the right thing, at the right time, and then based on that inspection,
                                    adapt as needed. Kanban's hyperfocus on transparency, visualization, and flow
                                    maximizes feedback, empiricism, and ultimately the delivery of value.</span></p>

                            <p><span>This equation reveals that the more work you have at any given time makes it take
