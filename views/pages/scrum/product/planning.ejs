							<h2>Planning in Product</h2>
							<p>
								<h3>Planning Layers</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Company Vision - Owned by execs or CEO</li>
									<li>Business Strategy - Owned by execs or CEO</li>
									<li>Product Vision - Owned by Product</li>
									<li>Product Strategy - Owned by Product</li>
									<li>Release Plan - Owned by Product</li>
									<li>Sprint Plan - Owned by Developers</li>
									<li>Daily Plan - Owned by Developers</li>
								</ul>

								All the items for product in the planning layers are considered a gap called the "Product Management Vacuum"
								If we are not careful, these can get filled with meaningless busy work and detailed task management. 
								You can easily run the risk of being busy without a clear intention.

								Vacuums can cause
								<ul>
									<li>Disconnected development tteam from the business</li>
									<li>Less engagement from those on the ground</li>
									<li>More Reliance on project and task management</li>
									<li>More hierarchies and handoffs</li>
									<li>More complexity</li>
									<li>Difficulty to shift directions</li>
									<li>More "busy work"</li>
									<li>More waste and rework</li>
									<li>Less value delivered to clients</li>
								</ul>

								<p>To fill vacuums, we can use the 3 Vs, Value, Validation and Vision</p>

								<h2>Vision</h2>
								<p class="lead">
									Creates transparency for the team around the overall idea behind the product. By communicating our intent clearly we enable those around us to make informed decisions without our help.
								</p>
								<p>To enable this self-organization, a shared vision and clear boundaries are absolutely necessary. Your vision should represent the voice of your customeres, which will result in better value delivery and retention.</p>
								<p>Connecting the product vision to the company's vision can be extremely helpful is maintaining and gaining alignment.</p>
								
								<h2>Value</h2>
								<p class="lead">
									If everything is important, then nothing is - Patrick Lencioni
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<h2>Validation</h2>
								<p class="lead">
									Validation causes <strong>Adaptation</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Most assumptions we make in business end up being wrong. The need to validate work will come at some point and by validating more frequently, we can help to minimize the overall risk we take in the PDLC.</p>
