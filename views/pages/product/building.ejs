						<h2>What is our product?</h2>

						<p>Is this product viable? Will it be able to deliver value? Will we receive a ROI for this product?</p>
						<h2>Who are we building for?</h2>
						<p>When building a product we must always keep in mind the Who of the product. Who is buying and consuming the Product that we are creating?</p>
