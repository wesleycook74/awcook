						<h2>What is our product?</h2>
						<p>What is the actual thing we are selling?</p>
						<p>Is this product viable? Will it be able to deliver value? Will we receive a ROI for this product?</p>
						<h2>Who are we building for?</h2>
						<p>When building a product we must always keep in mind the Who of the product. Who is buying and consuming the Product that we are creating?</p>
                        <h3>Empathy-Driven Development</h3>
                        <p>A truly valuable product will always keep in mind the who of what we are building. What do they struggle with? How do they use our product? How can we make their work and/or life better?</p>
                        <p>When we design and build with empathy, our products and solutions will be able to reflect that. The goal is that the users should be able to see that they are heard, seen and thought of. If they are an after thought, we may not be building the most valuable product possible.</p>
                        
                        <h2>What are the benefits of our product?</h2>
                        <p>What type of value are we passing on to our users? The idea of the Value Pyramid below is that each layer builds upon the next, to reach the more aspirational, higher value benefits, we must first focus on the lower ones. Over time this should lead us to higher value over time.</p>

                        <p>
                            While it may seem good to split a product into teams by component this can cause silos of knowledge, dependency issues, inventing of work, bad quality, loss of focus and much more.

                        <p>Build, Measure and Learn. Fail fast, learn fast. We need to allow the team to feel safe to make mistakes and try new things (see <a href="/scrum/notes/organization#psychological_safety">Psychological Safety</a>)</p>
