                    <p><span>Scrum is an empirical framework for solving complex problems in a complex world. Although hard to master, most of the key points of Scrum are digestible and good starts for any team. The foundation of Scrum sits on the pillars of Transparency, Adaption and Inspection. The thought is that without one of these pillars functioning we cannot have the other two. For example, if we are not transparent to our team on the work we are doing we cannot inspect the unknown work, if we are not inspecting frequently, we will not know what to adapt to and so on. The guide I have built up here is based on the teachings of Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland, et al. There are a lot of resources for learning about Scrum but I will always recommend starting with the initial inspiration for Scrum, <a href="https://www.agilepractice.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Product-Development-Scrum-1986.pdf" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">&quot;The New, New Product Development Game&quot;</a> by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. From there you can read the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Agile Manifesto</a>, the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">12 principals of Agile Software</a>, the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Scrum Guide</a> and <a href="http://scrumbook.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://scrumbook.org/</a> which will help guide you into Agile and Scrum and  you may choose to followup with the appropriate learning path for you on <a href="http://www.scrum.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Scrum.org</a>.</span></p><h1 id="Scrum-WhyScrum?"><span>Why Scrum?</span></h1><p><span>The biggest reason I can give for scrum follows what is called &quot;Conway's Law&quot;.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.”</span></p><p><span>Melvin E. Conway (Conway’s Law)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The thought is that your products will directly look like the communication and processes behind those products. If you look at this graphic depicting some of the most widely known product's communication structures you will immediately see the correlations to their respective product offerings.</span></p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" height="400" src="http://scrumbook.org.datasenter.no/images/ConwaysLaw_Head.png" data-image-src="http://scrumbook.org.datasenter.no/images/ConwaysLaw_Head.png"></span></p><p>When we think about Get Well's mission, the goal is for a seamless, interconnected patient journey that hits the right points of care for each and every patient. With this in mind and thinking about Conway's Law, we are looking to build an internal communication and process structure that is also interconnected, simple, and responsive. This structure is what Scrum offers, a communicative, simple structure for providing valuable software frequently.</p><p>There are a lot of things we already do so well and the goal of scrum is to bring to light those things that are not going as well as we would like. The journey through proper adoption of Scrum can be painful but the results can be seemingly miraculous. I hope this guide I have pulled together over a year of self-study will be useful for those who discover it! Please feel free to reach out at any time for questions, suggestions and anything else Scrum related! </p><p><br/></p><h1 id="Scrum-KeyPoints"><span>Key Points</span></h1><ul><li><span>Goals of Process should always be to reduce waste and maximize value</span></li><li><span>Constant Collaboration should come from everyone</span></li><li><span>Shared knowledge and a culture of teaching and coaching is important to the success of Scrum</span></li><li><span>Agile requires that we show our teammates that we trust and respect them through giving them space to learn and make mistakes</span></li><li><span>Scrum and Agile is not just the job of the Scrum Master and Scrum team but the whole organization.
