If price is a factor and you are not looking to attend a workshop, I would recommend PSPO but if you are looking for a workshop CSPO might be a better fit. Personally I like Scrum.org's approaches to scrum a little more than Scrum Alliance but you may find that you align more with Scrum Alliance. I would read up more on the Overview's and Missions of the two and find what fits your agile style more.</span></p><h4 id="ProductOwner-PSPO-ProfessionalScrumProductOwner"><span>PSPO - Professional Scrum Product Owner</span></h4><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(68,68,68);">$200 USD for certification license only.
