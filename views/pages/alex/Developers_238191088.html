This could include people who hold the workplace titles or roles of “Architect”, “Tester”, “QA Engineer”, “Software Engineer” or “Developer” while Scrum does not have titles for developers, it is known that the movement from traditional roles to a cross-functional team may be difficult.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span>For developers interested in Scrum, you can start with the Scrum.org <a href="https://www.scrum.org/pathway/software-developer-learning-path" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">learning path for developers</a>. If you're really interested they also offer a certification <a href="https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-developer-certification" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">PSD</a>.

We can ensure good architecture through planning some time each Sprint to discuss the architecture needed for the features planned in that Sprint and by having a set of guiding architecture principles that every Developer understands and follows when writing code.</span></p><h3 id="Developers-Spike"><span>Spike</span></h3><p><span>A small development activity to learn about technical elements of a proposed solution.</span></p>
